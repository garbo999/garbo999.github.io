I had some trouble getting the graphics parts of the Moses EMS running (probably since I am working on a Ubuntu Server without GUI). Finally today I got it running (I had to install the GraphViz toolkit and the GhostView tool as described in the [EMS documentation](http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=FactoredTraining.EMS) under "Requirements").

Here is the 1st PNG file:

The file is a bit small in my browser, but I am able to expand it to a decent size with the rollbar on my mouse.
