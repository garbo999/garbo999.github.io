I am getting started with machine translation (MT) using Moses SMT. I built this little blog to document my progress and organize my work.

Future projects:
1. Install the baseline system and test how well it works in the basic configuration ([DONE!](http://localhost:4000/moses/2017/06/01/results-from-moses-baseline-system.html))
2. Get the Experiment Management System running
3. Study language models with SRILM
4. Figure out how GIZA++ (MGIZA) really works
5. Implement algorithms for IBM models 1 to 5
6. Document some of the many Linux insights needed to efficiently work with Moses and related tools
