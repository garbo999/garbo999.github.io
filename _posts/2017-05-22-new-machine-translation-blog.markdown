I am getting started with machine translation (MT) using Moses SMT. I built this little blog to document my progress and organize my work.

Future projects:
1. Install the baseline system and test how well it works in the basic configuration ([DONE]({% post_url 2017-06-01-results-from-moses-baseline-system %}))
2. Get the Experiment Management System running ([DONE]({% post_url 2017-08-21-first-complete-run-moses-experiment-management-system %}))
3. Study language models with SRILM (or KenLM?)
4. Figure out how GIZA++ (MGIZA) really works
5. Implement algorithms for IBM models 1 to 5
6. Document Linux tricks to work with Moses and related tools
7. Look closer at the BLEU evaluation system
8. Look into [domain adaptation](http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Advanced.Domain)
9. Add tags to this blog
10. Add support for equations to this blog
