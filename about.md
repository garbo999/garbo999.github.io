After working for some years as a human translator (languages: German/French -> English), I am systematically exploring machine translation (MT). I have to thank the [BDÃœ](http://bdue.de/der-bdue/) for motivating me to learn about MT. In the spring of 2017, I translated a number of articles from their upcoming book on MT from German to English. The translation project was an eye-opener since it gave me a chance to see how MT is used today. The articles ranged from somewhat theoretical ("Machine translation of structurally different languages: Japanese and German") to highly practical ("Machine translation at Volkswagen AG").

I have been interested in machine learning since 2015 and I completed the [Stanford Machine Learning MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) in 2015. I also finished a [mini-diploma in machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) from the Univerity of Washington in 2016.

Now I am studying [Statistical Machine Translation](http://www.statmt.org/book/) by Philipp Koehn and working on implementing the IBM MT models in Python and C. I also plan to study [open-source neural machine translation systems](http://opennmt.net/).
